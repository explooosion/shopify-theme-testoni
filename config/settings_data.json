ADVICE","accsubheading":"It is important to take good care of your AMEDEO TESTONI shoes and prevent disfiguration. When putting them on, always unfasten the laces and use a shoehorn. Drying the shoes with direct heat is not advised as it might cause cracks to the exquisite and natural leather. If the shoes get wet, insert soft absorbent papers in the shoes to help draw the moisture. Since it takes at least 24 hours for the humidity absorbed in the leather to evaporate, we recommend not to wear the same shoes for two days in a row."}},"0c7e920e-30cb-4add-8140-b8a8a0802231":{"type":"text","settings":{"accheading":"CLEANING","accsubheading":"To avoid discoloration of the upper, cleaning is the first and crucial step. Use a stiff bristle brush to brush off insistent dirt. For tough stains, use a sponge and neutral soap to remove them gently. To deal with salt stains, diluted vinegar would be useful to get rid of them. To eliminate stains on suede, use very thin abrasive paper (type 00) and a rubberizing brush to orient the hair direction."}},"51f0b93c-57c3-4292-933d-a22735ef6ae8":{"type":"text","settings":{"accheading":"POLISHING","accsubheading":"After the cleaning process, the next step is to apply shoe polish onto your sophisticated AMEDEO TESTONTI shoes. When choosing the colour of the polish, it must match the colour of the shoes as much as possible. Avoid neutral tone as that tends to fade the upper colour. A slightly darker shade is recommended as it helps to accentuate the tonality of the leather. First, spread a proper amount of the polish with a natural bristle brush. Then use a clean and soft cloth to polish the shoes in a circular and delicate motion for at least five minutes to ensure perfect uniformity. Harmful covering and self-shining fast cream should be avoided."}},"aa67b5c6-339c-4e1c-9be4-78c513197f47":{"type":"text","settings":{"accheading":"SHINING","accsubheading":"Prior to the final polishing, it is essential to let the polish dry completely. When the polish is dry, use a soft brush to apply cream to the upper. Be careful not to overflow the cream to the sole. Afterwards, rub the upper with a woollen cloth, a silk stocking or a velvet brush. For suede, it is advised using a brush with rubber or thin brass bristles."}},"56c7473c-1f42-4cba-9eda-8fc2992e0649":{"type":"text","settings":{"accheading":"CARE","accsubheading":"To ensure the best care of your AMEDEO TESTONI leather shoes, all the hard parts, including soles and welts, should be treated with cream. It is also a good practice to keep the footwear with inserted wooden shoe trees. That helps the lining to dry better and stretch the upper perfectly. When travelling, it is advised to put the footwear in the cloth bags provided or wrap the shoes in soft fabric to avoid scratches."}}},"block_order":["660d7a20-bdbe-4b6f-8034-a27a62eac55e","0c7e920e-30cb-4add-8140-b8a8a0802231","51f0b93c-57c3-4292-933d-a22735ef6ae8","aa67b5c6-339c-4e1c-9be4-78c513197f47","56c7473c-1f42-4cba-9eda-8fc2992e0649"],"settings":{}},"header-terms-and-condition":{"type":"header-terms-and-condition","settings":{"termsconditionbanner":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/A.png"}},"season-preview-women-section2":{"type":"season-preview-women-section2","settings":{"enable_second_section":true,"productimage":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Burano_2.jpg","title":"LADY BURANO LEATHER SNEAKERS","description":"Perforated calf leather upper with XL ExtraLight® outsole epitomizes the hybrid power of craftsmanship and innovative technology.
